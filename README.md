A tidy data set developed for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course 
==================================================================

   This repository contains the R script and associated information code for building a tidy data set from
the Human Activity Recognition dataset.  In this file, we present only the information neccesary for the
present purposes.  A description of this database and futher information about this dataset can be obtained at the following link (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

Instructions
==================================================================

   The contents of this repository are as follows:

   1. run_analysis.R   --  The R script for processing the UCI HAR Dataset into a tidy dataset
   2. CodeBook.md    --
   3. README.md     --  This file.  A description of the current project.

   In addition, the user of this script will need to have complete copy of the UCI HAR Dataset which may be obtained at the following link.

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

   After downloading this zip file, unzip it and be sure that the directory 'UCI HAR Dataset' is in the same directory as the script run_analysis.R.

   The run the script run_analysis.R.  This should result in a txt file HAR_data.txt appearing in the same directory.  This is the necessary tidy data set.
